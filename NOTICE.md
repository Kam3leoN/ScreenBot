		The Artistic License 2.0
		
		Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
		
		Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
		of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
		
		Preamble
		
		This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
		Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
		The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
		control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
		Package available as open source and free software.
		
		You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
		license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
		terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
		make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
		a different licensing arrangement.
		
		Definitions
		
		    "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
		    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
		
		    "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
		    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
		    procedures.
		
		    "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
		    distribute, or modify the Package.
		
		    "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
		    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
		    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
		    Version, or a Modified Version.
		
		    "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
		    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
		    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
		
		    "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
		    this Package or providing support for this Package to another
		    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
		
		    "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
		    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
		    by the Copyright Holder.
		
		    "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
		    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
		    Holder.
		
		    "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
		    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
		    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
		
		    "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
		    configuration files for the Package.
		
		    "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
		    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
		    translation of the Source form.
		
		
		Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
		
		(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
		Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
		you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
		
		
		Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
		
		(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
		Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
		either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
		all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
		your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
		Compiled form of the Package.
		
		(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
		modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
		Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
		will be subject to the Original License.
		
		
		Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
		
		(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
		or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
		Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
		from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
		any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
		you do at least ONE of the following:
		
		    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
		    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
		    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
		    Version.
		
		    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
		    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
		    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
		    from the name of the Standard Version.
		
		    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
		    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
		    under
		
		        (i)  the Original License or
		
		        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
		        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
		        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
		        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
		        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
		        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
		        Fees are allowed.
		
		
		Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
		or Modified Versions without the Source
		
		(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
		the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
		get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
		valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
		time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
		must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
		If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
		days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
		you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
		
		(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
		the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
		the Source of the Modified Version.
		
		
		Aggregating or Linking the Package
		
		(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
		Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
		aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
		Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
		components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
		apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
		as included in the aggregation.
		
		(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
		other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
		build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
		include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
		provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
		
		
		Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
		
		(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
		merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
		the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
		considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
		terms of this license.
		
		
		General Provisions
		
		(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
		Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
		modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
		use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
		license.
		
		(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
		Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
		to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
		this license.
		
		(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
		service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
		
		(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
		free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
		sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
		patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
		infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
		(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
		that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
		infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
		date that such litigation is filed.
		
		(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
		THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
		IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
		WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
		NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
		LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
		BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
		DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
		ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

		--------
		
		
		The Artistic License 2.0
		
		Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
		
		Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
		of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
		
		Preamble
		
		This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
		Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
		The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
		control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
		Package available as open source and free software.
		
		You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
		license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
		terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
		make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
		a different licensing arrangement.
		
		Definitions
		
		    "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
		    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
		
		    "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
		    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
		    procedures.
		
		    "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
		    distribute, or modify the Package.
		
		    "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
		    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
		    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
		    Version, or a Modified Version.
		
		    "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
		    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
		    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
		
		    "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
		    this Package or providing support for this Package to another
		    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
		
		    "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
		    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
		    by the Copyright Holder.
		
		    "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
		    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
		    Holder.
		
		    "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
		    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
		    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
		
		    "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
		    configuration files for the Package.
		
		    "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
		    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
		    translation of the Source form.
		
		
		Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
		
		(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
		Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
		you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
		
		
		Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
		
		(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
		Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
		either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
		all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
		your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
		Compiled form of the Package.
		
		(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
		modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
		Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
		will be subject to the Original License.
		
		
		Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
		
		(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
		or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
		Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
		from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
		any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
		you do at least ONE of the following:
		
		    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
		    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
		    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
		    Version.
		
		    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
		    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
		    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
		    from the name of the Standard Version.
		
		    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
		    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
		    under
		
		        (i)  the Original License or
		
		        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
		        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
		        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
		        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
		        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
		        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
		        Fees are allowed.
		
		
		Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
		or Modified Versions without the Source
		
		(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
		the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
		get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
		valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
		time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
		must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
		If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
		days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
		you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
		
		(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
		the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
		the Source of the Modified Version.
		
		
		Aggregating or Linking the Package
		
		(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
		Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
		aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
		Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
		components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
		apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
		as included in the aggregation.
		
		(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
		other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
		build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
		include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
		provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
		
		
		Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
		
		(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
		merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
		the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
		considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
		terms of this license.
		
		
		General Provisions
		
		(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
		Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
		modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
		use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
		license.
		
		(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
		Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
		to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
		this license.
		
		(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
		service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
		
		(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
		free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
		sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
		patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
		infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
		(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
		that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
		infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
		date that such litigation is filed.
		
		(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
		THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
		IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
		WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
		NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
		LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
		BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
		DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
		ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

		The Artistic License 2.0
		
		Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
		
		Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
		of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
		
		Preamble
		
		This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
		Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
		The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
		control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
		Package available as open source and free software.
		
		You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
		license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
		terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
		make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
		a different licensing arrangement.
		
		Definitions
		
		    "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
		    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
		
		    "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
		    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
		    procedures.
		
		    "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
		    distribute, or modify the Package.
		
		    "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
		    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
		    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
		    Version, or a Modified Version.
		
		    "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
		    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
		    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
		
		    "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
		    this Package or providing support for this Package to another
		    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
		
		    "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
		    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
		    by the Copyright Holder.
		
		    "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
		    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
		    Holder.
		
		    "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
		    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
		    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
		
		    "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
		    configuration files for the Package.
		
		    "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
		    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
		    translation of the Source form.
		
		
		Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
		
		(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
		Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
		you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
		
		
		Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
		
		(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
		Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
		either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
		all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
		your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
		Compiled form of the Package.
		
		(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
		modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
		Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
		will be subject to the Original License.
		
		
		Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
		
		(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
		or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
		Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
		from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
		any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
		you do at least ONE of the following:
		
		    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
		    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
		    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
		    Version.
		
		    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
		    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
		    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
		    from the name of the Standard Version.
		
		    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
		    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
		    under
		
		        (i)  the Original License or
		
		        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
		        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
		        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
		        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
		        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
		        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
		        Fees are allowed.
		
		
		Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
		or Modified Versions without the Source
		
		(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
		the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
		get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
		valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
		time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
		must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
		If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
		days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
		you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
		
		(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
		the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
		the Source of the Modified Version.
		
		
		Aggregating or Linking the Package
		
		(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
		Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
		aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
		Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
		components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
		apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
		as included in the aggregation.
		
		(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
		other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
		build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
		include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
		provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
		
		
		Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
		
		(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
		merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
		the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
		considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
		terms of this license.
		
		
		General Provisions
		
		(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
		Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
		modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
		use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
		license.
		
		(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
		Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
		to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
		this license.
		
		(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
		service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
		
		(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
		free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
		sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
		patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
		infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
		(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
		that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
		infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
		date that such litigation is filed.
		
		(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
		THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
		IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
		WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
		NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
		LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
		BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
		DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
		ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

		The Artistic License 2.0
		
		Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
		
		Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
		of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
		
		Preamble
		
		This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
		Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
		The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
		control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
		Package available as open source and free software.
		
		You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
		license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
		terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
		make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
		a different licensing arrangement.
		
		Definitions
		
		    "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
		    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
		
		    "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
		    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
		    procedures.
		
		    "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
		    distribute, or modify the Package.
		
		    "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
		    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
		    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
		    Version, or a Modified Version.
		
		    "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
		    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
		    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
		
		    "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
		    this Package or providing support for this Package to another
		    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
		
		    "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
		    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
		    by the Copyright Holder.
		
		    "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
		    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
		    Holder.
		
		    "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
		    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
		    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
		
		    "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
		    configuration files for the Package.
		
		    "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
		    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
		    translation of the Source form.
		
		
		Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
		
		(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
		Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
		you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
		
		
		Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
		
		(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
		Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
		either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
		all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
		your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
		Compiled form of the Package.
		
		(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
		modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
		Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
		will be subject to the Original License.
		
		
		Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
		
		(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
		or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
		Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
		from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
		any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
		you do at least ONE of the following:
		
		    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
		    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
		    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
		    Version.
		
		    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
		    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
		    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
		    from the name of the Standard Version.
		
		    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
		    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
		    under
		
		        (i)  the Original License or
		
		        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
		        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
		        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
		        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
		        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
		        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
		        Fees are allowed.
		
		
		Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
		or Modified Versions without the Source
		
		(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
		the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
		get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
		valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
		time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
		must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
		If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
		days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
		you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
		
		(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
		the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
		the Source of the Modified Version.
		
		
		Aggregating or Linking the Package
		
		(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
		Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
		aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
		Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
		components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
		apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
		as included in the aggregation.
		
		(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
		other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
		build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
		include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
		provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
		
		
		Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
		
		(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
		merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
		the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
		considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
		terms of this license.
		
		
		General Provisions
		
		(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
		Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
		modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
		use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
		license.
		
		(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
		Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
		to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
		this license.
		
		(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
		service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
		
		(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
		free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
		sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
		patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
		infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
		(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
		that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
		infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
		date that such litigation is filed.
		
		(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
		THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
		IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
		WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
		NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
		LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
		BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
		DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
		ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

		2\. Grant of Copyright License.

		3\. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		4\. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
		
		You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
		
		You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
		
		5\. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		6\. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		7\. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		8\. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

		                           Version 2.0, January 2004
		                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/
		
		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		   1. Definitions.
		
		      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
		      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
		
		      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
		      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
		
		      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
		      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
		      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
		      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
		      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
		      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
		
		      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		      exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
		
		   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
		
		      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
		      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
		      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
		      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
		      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
		      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
		      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
		      identification within third-party archives.

		"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

		"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		2\. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		3\. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		4\. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
		
		You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
		
		You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
		
		If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
		
		5\. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		6\. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		7\. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		8\. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

		THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
		BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
		   1. Definitions
		      a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
		      b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
		      c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
		      d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
		      e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
		      f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
		      g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
		      h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
		      i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
		   2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
		   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
		      a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
		      b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
		      c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
		      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
		      e. For the avoidance of doubt:
		         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
		         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
		         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
		   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
		   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
		      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
		      b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
		      c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
		   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
		   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
		   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
		   7. Termination
		      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
		      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
		   8. Miscellaneous
		      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
		      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
		      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
		      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You.
		      e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
		      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
		Creative Commons Notice
		Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
		Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

* Licenses
    * CC0-1.0
        * Attribution:
        CC0 1.0 Universal<<endOptional>>
		Statement of Purpose
		The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
		Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
		For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
		   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
		      i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
		      ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
		      iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
		      iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
		      v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
		      vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
		      vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
		   2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
		   3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
		   4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
		      a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
		      b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
		      c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
		      d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

		     #
		     #  A large portion of the dictionary entries
		     #  originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
		     #  Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.
		     #
		     #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
		     #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
		     #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
		     #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
		     #  in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
		     #  distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
		     #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
		     #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
		     #
		     #  NO WARRANTY
		     #
		     #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
		     #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided
		     #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
		     #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
		     #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
		     #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
		     #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
		     #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
		     #  any right of any third party.
		     #
		     #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
		     #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
		     #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
		     #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
		     #
		     #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
		     #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
		     #  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
		     #  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all

		     #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
		     #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
		     #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
		     #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
		     #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
		     #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
		     #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
		     #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
		     #  production of secondary products from the program.
		     #
		     #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or

		     #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in

		    5. Time Zone Database
		
		      ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
		    Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
		    is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
		    Database section 7.
		
		     # 7.  Database Ownership
		     #
		     #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
		     #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
		     #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
		     #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
		     #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
		     #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
		     #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
		     #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
		     #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
		     #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
		     #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
		     #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
		     #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

		    Preamble
		
		    This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
		    Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
		    The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
		    control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
		    Package available as open source and free software.
		
		    You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
		    license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
		    terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
		    make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
		    a different licensing arrangement.
		
		    Definitions
		
		        "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
		        named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
		
		        "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
		        material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
		        procedures.
		
		        "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
		        distribute, or modify the Package.
		
		        "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
		        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
		        those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
		        Version, or a Modified Version.
		
		        "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
		        accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
		        organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
		
		        "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
		        this Package or providing support for this Package to another
		        party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
		
		        "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
		        modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
		        by the Copyright Holder.
		
		        "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
		        such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
		        Holder.
		
		        "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
		        the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
		        it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
		
		        "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
		        configuration files for the Package.
		
		        "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
		        or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
		        translation of the Source form.
		
		    Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
		
		    (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
		    Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
		    you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
		
		    Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
		
		    (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
		    Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
		    either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
		    all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
		    your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
		    Compiled form of the Package.
		
		    (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
		    modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
		    Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
		    will be subject to the Original License.
		
		    Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
		
		    (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
		    or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
		    Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
		    from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
		    any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
		    you do at least ONE of the following:
		
		        (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
		        of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
		        Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
		        Version.
		
		        (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
		        prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
		        addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
		        from the name of the Standard Version.
		
		        (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
		        make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
		        under
		
		            (i)  the Original License or
		
		            (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
		            modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
		            licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
		            received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
		            Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
		            available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
		            Fees are allowed.
		
		    Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
		    or Modified Versions without the Source
		
		    (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
		    the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
		    get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
		    valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
		    time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
		    must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
		    If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
		    days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
		    you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
		
		    (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
		    the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
		    the Source of the Modified Version.
		
		    Aggregating or Linking the Package
		
		    (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
		    Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
		    aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
		    Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
		    components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
		    apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
		    as included in the aggregation.
		
		    (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
		    other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
		    build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
		    include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
		    provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
		
		    Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
		
		    (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
		    merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
		    the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
		    considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
		    terms of this license.
		
		    General Provisions
		
		    (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
		    Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
		    modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
		    use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
		    license.
		
		    (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
		    Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
		    to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
		    this license.
		
		    (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
		    service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
		
		    (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
		    free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
		    sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
		    patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
		    infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
		    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
		    that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
		    infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
		    date that such litigation is filed.
		
		    (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
		    THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
		    IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
		    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
		    NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
		    LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
		    BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
		    DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
		    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		   1. Definitions.

		      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
